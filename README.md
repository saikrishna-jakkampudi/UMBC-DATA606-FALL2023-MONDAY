    <p><b> Predictive Analysis for Diabetes Detection among Patients</b></p>
    <p>We built models for predicting the amount of vulnerability associated with being diagnosed with diabetes using patient diagnostic records from a lab. Using Python modules, I preprocessed the data, found patterns in the data, developed models, and showed the results.</p>
    <p><b>IOWA Spirit Sales</b></p>
    <p>Iowa spirits sales statistics (2012-2022) were examined. End-to-end data processing, modeling, and interactive visualization were accomplished using Python (Jupyter), Apache Spark, and Power BI. Insights on trends, vendor selection, and shop placements were gained, allowing for more educated business plans.</p>
    <p><b>Newyork Wi-Fi Hotspots</b></p>
    <p>In this study, we studied New York City's public Wi-Fi hotspots to discover service provider kinds and network services, allowing us to make better Wi-Fi service selections. For data storage, we used AWS S3, AWS Glue for data modeling, and AWS RDS for database administration, using SQL for queries and Power BI for dynamic visualization.</p>
    <p><b>Baltimore Water Quality Analysis</b></p>
    <p>In the study of Baltimore water quality, we discovered general improvements over time seasonal swings Location-based changes connected to elements such as rainfall, temperature, and land. Using Python modules for data visualizations assisted us in proposing that we invest in a better laboratory for data accuracy and dependability.</p>
